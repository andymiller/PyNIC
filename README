Python implementaiton of "A Nonparametric Information Theoretic Clustering Algorithm" (ICML '10) 
by Faivishevsky and Goldberger

Depends on numpy, scipy, and matplotlib for optional plotting. 

Run "python nic.py" for a clustering example, and run
"eval.py" for a comparison with k-means

update:
I factored out some computation in the score learning - instead of recomputing 
all distances between points in all clusters, I just recompute the distances that
include the point in question and subtract/add to clusters.  This idea can be taken even 
farther for more than 2 clusters.  K means comparison is super cool - this process is a 
little slower than k means, but it allows for much more interesting distributions.
